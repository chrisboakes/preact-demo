# Preact

## POC

Project repo: [https://github.com/chrisboakes/preact-demo](https://github.com/chrisboakes/preact-demo)

Built project: TBC

I used the [preact-cli](https://github.com/preactjs/preact-cli) to prototype this POC and used some dummy data to imitate the content API.

This POC is a mixture of statically generated, server-side rendered and client side rendered data:

- [Static rendering](#Static-Rendering): the home page
- [Client-side rendering](#Client-Side-Rendering): the politics page and the politics articles

## Further research

- Dynamic `<title>` and metadata

## CLI Commands

``` bash
# install dependencies
npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
npm run dev

# build for production with minification
npm run build

# test the production build locally
npm run serve

# run tests with jest and preact-render-spy 
npm run test
```
